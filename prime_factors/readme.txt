Prime Factors

Any non-prime number can be reduced to the product of smaller prime numbers.

Example: 6 can be reduced to 2x3. 12 can be reduced to 2x2x3.

Using tests, you will test-drive a method to calculate prime factors.

Rules:
1) You must start at a test for two and increment by one for each subsequent test. So your first test is to factor 2, your second test is to factor 3, etc.
2) All tests are additive so by the time you are testing 4, there should be three tests that are continuing to pass.
3) Do not attempt to google the solution to a prime factors problem. That's been done before and it removes any learning you might have got from this exercise. The point is to evolve the code to a state where it solves a greater and greater portion of the overall problem.
4) Stop when you think you have a general solution that would work for any number. How would you validate that assumption?
